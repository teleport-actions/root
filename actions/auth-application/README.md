# `teleport-actions/auth-application`

`auth-application` uses Teleport Machine ID to generate credentials for
accessing an application protected by Teleport.

The action has the following outputs:

- `certificate-file`: the path to the client certificate to use with requests to
  the application.
- `key-file`: the path to the private key for the client certificate to use with
  request to the application.

Pre-requisites:

- Teleport 11 or above must be used.
- Teleport binaries must already be installed in the job environment.
- The Applicatiom you wish to access must already be connected to your Teleport
  cluster. See
  <https://goteleport.com/docs/application-access/getting-started/>
- You must have created a bot with a role with access to your Application and
  created a GitHub join token that allows that bot to join.
- A Linux based runner.

Example usage:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Install Teleport
    uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
    with:
      version: 11.0.3
  - name: Fetch application credentials
    id: auth
    uses: teleport-actions/auth-application@v1
    with:
      # Specify the publically accessible address of your Teleport proxy.
      proxy: tele.example.com:443
      # Specify the name of the join token for your bot.
      token: my-github-join-token-name
      # Specify the length of time that the generated credentials should be
      # valid for. This is optional and defaults to "1h"
      certificate-ttl: 1h
      # Specify the name of the application you wish to access.
      app: grafana-example
  - name: Make request
    run: curl --cert {{ steps.auth.outputs.certificate-file }} --key {{ steps.auth.outputs.key-file }} https://grafana-example.tele.example.com/api/users
```
